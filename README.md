# Missing Indicator Method

This is the codebase to reproduce results from the paper *The Missing Indicator Method: An Efficient Preprocessor for Informative Missing Values*.

## Requirements

Code tested with python=3.8.  Packages can be installed via `pip` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  To use conda, first create a conda environment with pip using `conda create -n name_of_env pip` and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the environment.

## Training

The `train_scripts` directory contains scripts that can be run to generate the data used to make our figures and tables.  The scripts can all be run from the terminal.  The arguments for each script can be found in the README in the `train_scripts` directory.
